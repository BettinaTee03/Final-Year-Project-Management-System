Hello! Thank you for taking the time to read this readme.txt file :)

In our Java application, we will be reading from and writing into the Excel sheets stored in the Excel_Sheets folder (not to be confused with Excel_Sheets_OG).

Every time a user starts the application, makes changes, and exits the portal WITHOUT closing the console, these changes will be reflected in the Excel sheets. The updated sheets will be read the next time a user starts the application again. For example, if a student was previously deregistered from their project and the program was terminated normally, that student will still be deregistered the next time the program is run.

To reset all of the information within the Excel sheets, please copy and paste the Excel sheets in the Excel_Sheets_OG folder into the Excel_Sheets folder. The Excel sheets which we will be using in our Java program will now be reset, with all the students being NOTREGISTERED, all faculty are FREE, and all projects AVAILABLE.

Happy testing!
